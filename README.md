This is a reimplementation of the Re3 tracker, originally seen in this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06368).

The code base is a pytorch implementation from the open sourced version of Re3 found [here](https://gitlab.cs.washington.edu/xkcd/re3-tensorflow) which is implemented in Tensorflow.


Inspiration was also taken from (https://github.com/AbhishekKumar16/CV_Project)
